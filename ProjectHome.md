A small, simple radio application for radio capturing cards using video4linux2 to interface to kernels and qt4 for the GUI part.

The distinguishing feature will be support for cards providing
mpeg2 as output stream for radio, like the Hauppauge PVR series
(including the pvrusb2).

This also serves as a pet project to test and experiment with the various technologies involved.
